## 2. Hardened Quality Gates (Build Pipeline)

Every production build executes 5 deterministic audit gates before Vite packaging:
1. `scripts/audit/assert_best_for.mjs`: Validates 114/114 domain mappings.
2. `scripts/assert-disclaimer.mjs`: Ensures 100% disclaimer compliance across all 59 regulated assets.
3. `scripts/assert-no-claims.mjs`: Guarantees 0 forbidden marketing claims ("enterprise-grade", "production-ready", "flight-qualified").
4. `scripts/assert-license-matrix.mjs`: Verifies SKU and licensing consistency across 114 blueprints.
5. `scripts/assert-flagships-gate4.mjs`: Validates schema integrity, SQL migration policies, and RLS tables for all 28 Flagships.
